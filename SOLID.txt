In Customer class
-Open/closed principle
Turned member variables in this class into private variables, to prevent modification, but there could still be more variables added allowing for extension.

-Single responsibility principle.  
I made 1 member method originally that I was able to break apart into 2 seperate methods, I split them up to handle different responsibilies individually.
